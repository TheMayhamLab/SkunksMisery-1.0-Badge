# SkunksMisery-1.0-Badge
Skunks Misery 1.0 Compass badge

This is the official badge for the Skunks Misery 1.0 conference. Since this is a hacker camp conference, we decided to make a compass that could be used while at the camp. 

The badge has eight LEDs around the circumference of the PCB which, when lit, indicate a Northerly direction. As the compass is moved around, the LEDs will turn on and off so that only the LED(s) pointing North will be illuminated.
